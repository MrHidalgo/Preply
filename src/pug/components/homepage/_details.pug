				p.details__desc.details__desc-2!= 'Maybe you’re learning a new language for the first time. Or maybe you’ve sat through hours in the classroom, battled grammar textbooks and downloaded every app. But after hours and hours of practice, you still can’t speak confidently! You can barely make a sentence! And you feel like throwing your worksheets down, shouting: <i>“I just don’t have a language brain.”</i>'
				p.details__desc.details__desc-3 If you feel this way, your brain isn’t broken! You just need to try a more effective approach.

				h2.details__title.details__title-2.details__title--sub!= "Every month, <span>over 500,000 students</span> trust Preply to achieve their language goals."

				.details__info
					span Our method is based on one commonsense truth:
					p the fastest way to learn a language is by practicing it with a native speaker.

				p.details__desc.details__desc-4 Preply is a platform that connects students and expert language tutors for 1-on-1 online video language lessons, held at flexible times, locations, and price points. Here are  7 reasons why Preply will fast-track your journey to fluency:

				h3.details__heading.details__heading-1
					span #1
					p Speak from the first lesson 🎤
				p.details__desc.details__desc-5 The number one problem when learning a new language? No speaking practice!  Without practicing speaking in your lessons, it’s so much harder -- and more nerve-wracking! -- to speak the language in real life.
				p.details__desc.details__desc-6 What we all know instinctively is backed up by science. A 2016 study published by The Modern Language Journal demonstrated that students learning a language with conversations over webcam tend to see much faster results than those using traditional methods. Scientists followed two groups of students who were learning English at a Japanese university:
				ul.details__list
					li

							i.icon-font.icon-flash
						div
							p!= "<span>Group A</span> did one hour of grammar and vocabulary exercises per week"
					li
						div
							i.icon-font.icon-flash
						div
							p!= "<span>Group B</span> spent an hour per week talking to native English speakers using video technology"
				p.details__desc.details__desc-7 After twelve weeks, it was found that Group A had made no significant improvement, but Group B had developed their language skills significantly. They had gained more varied vocabulary, performed better in listening comprehension tests, had a better understanding of grammar, and could speak more confidently.

				h3.details__heading.details__heading-2

					p Only pay what you can afford 💸
				p.details__desc.details__desc-8 In the past, private language lessons were pretty expensive. With Preply, you decide what you can pay, and the filter shows you who is offering lessons within your budget. Prices start from $5 per hour, so there’s a tutor to suit every wallet.

				h3.details__heading.details__heading-3
					span #3
					p Focus on the skills you need 🔎
				p.details__desc.details__desc-9 When learning in language schools, students often have to study vocabulary that they can’t really use in everyday life. This can be really frustrating! Learning the names of all the animals in a zoo just isn’t going to be that helpful if you’re learning a language to present in a boardroom!
				p.details__desc.details__desc-10 With Preply, you can skip straight to the good stuff. If you’re learning a language for work, for example, a tutor can help you rehearse presentations or write your emails. Lessons will work towards your goals with laser focus.

				h3.details__heading.details__heading-4
					span #4
					p Make learning work for your schedule 🗓
				p.details__desc.details__desc-11 Like language learning apps, Preply is great for busy people. Thanks to different time zones, there are tutors available to teach 24/7. You can schedule lessons around work, in your lunch break — even at night if it suits you!
				p.details__desc.details__desc-12 Learning with 1-on-1 lessons also really speeds up the pace of your progress compared to a classroom setting. You’ll receive corrections on your mistakes and learn from them on the spot. This is a fast-track to fluency.

					p Learn whenever, wherever 💡
				p.details__desc.details__desc-13 Commuting to a language school across town costs you time and money. If you’re feeling lazy or tired it’s so easy to just....not go. With Preply, anywhere with a wifi connection can be your classroom! Learn from your bed, your kitchen table, a quiet cafe terrace in the Bahamas -- it’s a lot harder to say “I couldn’t make it” and a lot easier to stick to your learning targets.

				h3.details__heading.details__heading-6
					span #6
					p 100% money back guarantee 🛡
				p.details__desc.details__desc-14 There’s no financial risk in trying Preply. If your lesson wasn’t fantastic, it’s free. Preply will refund you or give you a replacement lesson with a new tutor. This way, you can be sure to find a tutor who you do click with.

				h3.details__heading.details__heading-7

					p Find the best tutor for YOUR learning style 🥇
				p.details__desc.details__desc-15 The best thing about Preply? Students are guaranteed to find an effective tutor who they genuinely like. You can search the tutor database to find the perfect person for your budget, schedule and learning motivation.
				p.details__desc.details__desc-16 Most of our students really look forward to seeing their tutor’s friendly face every week. Having a tutor rooting for you is a great motivation for sticking to your learning goals.
